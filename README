clutil-osx is a suite providing Linux-style utility programs for OS X.

The suite currently includes one program:
 * free
   Duplicates much of the behaviour of the procps version of `free`,
   including the format of the first two lines, and the -k, -m, -g, and
   --si options.

The behaviour of these programs is similar to that on common Linux
distributions for those with trained fingers, but works on top of OS X
tooling and primitives.
